You can set the behavior for two time periods; a peak time schedule and an off-peak schedule. The sync settings can be any of the following: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Always connected \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Manual \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Every 15 minutes \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Every 30 minutes \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Every hour \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Every 2 hours If you specify a different sync setting for peak and off-peak times, then you must specify the peak time period. You can define the days of the week for the peak time and when the peak time should start and stop. For example, you might define the sync behavior to be Always Connected between your working hours (Monday \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.), then define your off-peak setting as Every 2 hours.",
